# musical-events-app

This app is for semi-learning purposes of Next.
The core functionality:

-   Calendar picker
-   Events can be added to a certain date (1 per day)
-   To-do list will be added to every event
    I will use it for my cello classes and practices.

Setup:
✅ Next.js with TypeScript (frontend)

✅ Node.js + Express with TypeScript (backend)

✅ PostgreSQL via Prisma (backend only)
